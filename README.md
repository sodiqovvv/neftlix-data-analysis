# Neftlix Data Analysis Project

In this project, I focused on cleaning the dataset and visualizing for analysis. I used Python with pandas library. The code fills empty spaces within the dataset for better observations and has some elementary operations: finding all unique genres, for example.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset contains information about the movies and TV shows, such as:

* Id
* Genre
* Duration
* Description of movie
* Rating
* Cast
* Country
* Title

## 🧹 Data Cleaning

I handled missing values with the following steps:

* Filled missing `director`, `cast`, `country` values with the word `Unknown`.
* Saved the cleaned dataset as `processed_data.csv`.

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis

I have done some analysis such as:

### 1. Knowing what are the all unique genres.

### 2. Observing all the rating values.

### 3. Comparing release years.

### 4. How many movies and TV shows found.

## ✅ Tools Used

* Python 🐍
* pandas 📊
* matplotlib 📈

## 📌 Conclusion

This project helped me understand basic data analysis techniques using Python. How huge datasets are handled and cleaning before observing are the two key takeaways.
